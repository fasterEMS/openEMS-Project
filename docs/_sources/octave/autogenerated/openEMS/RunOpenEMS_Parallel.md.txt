RunOpenEMS_Parallel
===================
```{function}  RunOpenEMS_Parallel(Sim_Paths, Sim_Files, opts, Settings, varargin)
```
Full definition:
```{code-block} matlab
function [stdout, stderr] = RunOpenEMS_Parallel(Sim_Paths, Sim_Files, opts, Settings, varargin)
```

Run multiple openEMS simulations in parallel, distributed on multiple 
machines using a ssh host_list! (currently on Linux only)

This function relies on InitQueue etc.

input:
- Sim_Paths:  cell array of paths to simulate by RunOpenEMS
- Sim_Files:  filename or cell array of filenames to simulate
- opts:       openEMS options. see also RunOpenEMS
- Settings:   use the settings to define multiple host for simulation
              e.g.: Settings.SSH.bin ='<path_to_openEMS>/openEMS.sh';
                    Settings.SSH.host_list = {'list','of','hosts'};

Note: If no SSH host_list is defined, this function will skip the
      parallel run and switch back to a default RunOpenEMS!
