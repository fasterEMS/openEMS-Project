AnalyzeNF2FF
============
```{function}  AnalyzeNF2FF( Sim_Path, filenames_E, filenames_H, f, theta, phi, r )
```
Full definition:
```{code-block} matlab
[E_theta,E_phi,Prad,Dmax] = AnalyzeNF2FF( Sim_Path, filenames_E, filenames_H, f, theta, phi, r )
```

calculates the farfield via a near field to far field transformation

input:
- Sim_Path:    simulation directory
- nf2ff:       structure on filenames etc. as created by CreateNF2FFBox 
- f:           frequency (Hz) for far field calculation
- theta:       (degrees) vector of discrete theta values to calculate the far field for
- phi:         (degrees) vector of discrete phi values to calculate the far field for
- r:           (optional) Radius (m) at which the E-fields are calculated (default: 1 m)

output:
- E_theta:     E_theta(theta,phi); theta component of the electric field strength at radius r
- E_phi:       E_phi(theta,phi);     phi component of the electric field strength at radius r
- Prad:        time averaged radiated power
- Dmax:        maximum directivity
