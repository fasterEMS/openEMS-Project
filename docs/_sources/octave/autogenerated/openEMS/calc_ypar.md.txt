calc_ypar
=========
```{function}  calc_ypar( f, ports, Sim_Path_Prefix )
```
Full definition:
```{code-block} matlab
Y = calc_ypar( f, ports, Sim_Path_Prefix )
```

- f: frequency vector (Hz)
- ports: cell array of ports (see AddMSLPort() and AddLumpedPort())
- Sim_Path_Prefix: prefix of the simulation dirs (will be postfixed by
  excitation port number)

This function calculates the Y-matrix representation of the ports

It is assumed that each port (inside ports) is excited and the
corresponding simulation was carried out at Sim_Path + portnr (e.g. for
port 2: '/tmp/sim2')
