AddCurvePort
============
```{function}  AddCurvePort( CSX, prio, portnr, R, start, stop [, excite, varargin] )
```
Full definition:
```{code-block} matlab
[CSX,port] = AddCurvePort( CSX, prio, portnr, R, start, stop [, excite, varargin] )
```

Creates a curve port (1-dimensional).
The mesh must already be initialized.

input:
- CSX:    CSX-object created by InitCSX()
- prio:   priority for excitation, metal, sheet and probe boxes
- portnr: (integer) number of the port
- R:      internal resistance of the port
- start:  3D start rowvector for port definition
- stop:   3D end rowvector for port definition
- excite (optional): if true, the port will be switched on (see AddExcitation())
                      Note: for legacy support a string will be accepted
optional (key/values):
  varargin:   optional additional excitations options, see also AddExcitation
  'PortNamePrefix': a prefix to the port name

output:
- CSX:
- port:

example:

    start = [0 0 0]; stop = [0 0 12];

this defines a lumped port in z-direction
the excitation/probe is placed between start(1) and stop(1)
