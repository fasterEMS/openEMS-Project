AddMRStub
=========
```{function}  AddMRStub( CSX, materialname, prio, MSL_width, len, alpha, resolution, orientation, normVector, position )
```
Full definition:
```{code-block} matlab
CSX = AddMRStub( CSX, materialname, prio, MSL_width, len, alpha, resolution, orientation, normVector, position )
```

Microstrip Radial Stub

- CSX: CSX-object created by InitCSX()
- materialname: property for the MSL (created by AddMetal() or AddMaterial())
- prio: priority
- MSL_width: width of the MSL to connect the stub to
- len: length of the radial stub
- alpha: angle subtended by the radial stub (degrees) 
- resolution: discrete angle spacing (degrees)
- orientation: angle of main direction of the radial stub (degrees)
- normVector: normal vector of the stub
- position: position of the end of the MSL

This radial stub definition is equivalent to the one Agilent ADS uses.

example:

    CSX = AddMRStub( CSX, 'PEC', 10, 1000, 5900, 30, 1, -90, [0 0 1], [0 -10000 254] );
