Drude, Debye and Lorentz Materials
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Debye, Drude, and Lorentz materials are advanced materials models that
capture the material's frequency-dependent changes in permittivity and
permeability. Since nearly all real-world materials exhibit this behavior,
they're used when the material's wideband response (such as dispersion)
must be accurately simulated.

These models were originally proposed in the early 20th century by
solid-state physicists to explain the microscopic origins of electrical
and optical properties of matter. Thus, these models do not accept a
simple array of frequency-dependent material properties, but instead
are controlled by parameters like *plasma frequency*, *plasma relaxation
time*, and *Lorentz pole frequency*.

These terms may mean very little to an RF/microwave engineer, but in FDTD, 
they act as calculation tools rather than physical theories. The required
parameters are obtained by numerically fitting them to the measured material
curves, so that these models produce the same curves which is then used in
the simulation. Both first-order models and high-order models are supported,
there are many "degrees of freedom" in the fitting process. If a first-order
fit fails to produce the desired curves, more parameters can be added until
one obtains a satisfactory fit.

.. note::
   FDTD only borrows these solid-state physics models as tools of calculations,
   the fitted parameters are generally not physically meaningful. 
   As von Neumann once said, "With four parameters I can fit an elephant,
   and with five I can make him wiggle his trunk."
