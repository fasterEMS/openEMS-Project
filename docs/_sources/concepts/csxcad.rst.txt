CSXCAD
=========

Initialization
---------------

An openEMS simulation always starts by creating a 3D model of the structure
using the CSXCAD library. All created entities for the simulation are stored
in the ``csx`` data structure (or Python object), which must be initialized
first. It's done by either the :func:`InitCSX` method in Matlab/Octave, or
the :class:`~CSXCAD.ContinuousStructure` class in Python::

    % Matlab/Octave
    csx = InitCSX();

    # Python
    import CSXCAD
    csx = CSXCAD.ContinuousStructure()

Once initialized, 3D models can be created by the functions provided by CSXCAD.
In Matlab/Octave, nearly all of them accept an old instance of the `csx` data
structure, and returns a modified new one. The Python binding has a more modern
coding style in comparison, which achieves this via class methods rather than
functions::

    % Matlab/Octave
    csx = AddExample(csx, arg1, arg2, arg3, ...)

    # Python
    csx.AddExample(arg1, arg2, arg3, ...)

These CSXCAD functions can be classified into two types, *properties*
and *primitives*. They define material properties and shapes respectively.

*Properties* defines the physical property of a material, such as a metal,
a thin conducting sheet, a dielectric metarial, a magnetic material.
Technically, excitation sources, probes, and field dump boxes are also
*Properties*.

*Primitives* are the building blocks to create 1D, 2D, 3D shapes, so that one
can create simple object such as a Curve, a Polygon, a Box, or a Sphere. More
complex structures can be created by combining various primitives. For example,
a metal sheet with cylindrical holes can be achieved by combining a metal box
with several air cylinders.

   See :ref:`concept_properties` and :ref:`concept_primitives` for details.

Coordinate Systems
-------------------

By default, a Cartesian coordinate system is used, which is suitable for
most simulations. If the simulated structure is predominantly round, the
Cartesian mesh may have a difficult time aligning itself with an object's
surfaces. Hence openEMS provides the alternative cylindrical coordinate
system to minimize staircasing errors::

    % Matlab/Octave
    csx = InitCSX('CoordSystem', '1');
    
    # Python
    import CSXCAD
    csx = CSXCAD.ContinuousStructure(CoordSystem=1)

.. note::

   This mainly affects meshing of the simulation box during a simulation,
   not the coordinates of 3D structures themselves. When creating 3D
   models, their coordinates do follow the meshing coordinate system by
   default, but it can always be overridden.

Saving
-----------

Once modeled, the CSXCAD data structure is usually saved to disk as an
``.xml`` file. It can be inspected by the :program:`AppCSXCAD` 3D viewer
for debugging::

    AppCSXCAD simulation.xml

.. figure:: images/appcsxcad.png
   :class: with-border
   :width: 50%

   AppCSXCAD, CSXCAD's official 3D model viewer and editor.

In the Matlab/Octave binding, both the geometry and simulation parameters
are saved together as a self-contained ``.xml`` file. The former is
created by :func:`InitCSX` and controlled by the ``csxcad`` data structure,
the latter is created by :func:`InitFDTD` and controlled by the ``fdtd`` data
structure. Hence :func:`WriteOpenEMS` requires both inputs::

    CSX = InitCSX();
    FDTD = InitFDTD();

    path = '/tmp';
    filename = 'simulation.xml';
    
    % write openEMS compatible xml-file
    WriteOpenEMS([path '/' filename], fdtd, csx);

In the Python binding, only the CSXCAD geometry information is saved to
the ``.xml`` file using the :meth:`~CSXCAD.ContinuousStructure.Write2XML`
method::

    import pathlib

    simdir = pathlib.Path("./")
    xmlname = pathlib.Path("simulation.xml")
    
    # concat two paths
    xmlpath = simdir / xmlname
    
    csx.Write2XML(str(xmlpath))  # convert Path object to string

Import & Export
---------------

Several Matlab/Octave functions are provided to import or export the
CSXCAD model to other formats, they include:

* :func:`ImportPLY`, :func:`ImportSTL`:

  * Especially useful for importing a 3rd-party 3D model (such as a
    connector).

* :func:`export_gerber`, :func:`export_excellon`:

  * CAM file outputs for fabrication. Useful for automated generation of
    planar circuits.

* :func:`export_empire`:

  * For comparing simulation results with proprietary, commercial
    tools.

* :func:`export_povray`:

  * For rendering fancy ray-traced 3D images.

.. note::

   **Python.** These functions are not implemented in Python yet. As
   a workaround, for importing, one can use Matlab/Octave to import an
   STL model (:func:`ImportSTL`), export the result to ``.xml``, and
   load the
   model in Python via :meth:`~CSXCAD.ContinuousStructure.ReadFromXML`.
   For exporting, :program:`AppCSXCAD` itself can generate POV-Ray,
   STL, X3D, Polydata-VTK, and PNG file formats.

   **Importing is easy, meshing is hard.**
   Importing an external model is considered an advanced feature, beginners
   are *not recommended* to try them before familiarizing themselves with the
   CSXCAD/openEMS workflow first via basic simulations, as described in
   :ref:`first_lessons`. Creating a
   meshing-friendly model (see :ref:`concept_mesh`) is often difficult,
   so a model and a mesh is usually co-developed. If a model comes from
   another source, yet the user is not already familiar with the meshing
   process and its pitfalls, confusing problems may arise.

Models and Simulations Reuse
------------------------------

The development of the Matlab/Octave and Python bindings took different
paths, as a result, they behave differently in terms of reusing models
and simulations.

Matlab/Octave
"""""""""""""

The Matlab/Octave binding was written as a pure "XML generator frontend"
to CSXCAD, and the openEMS executable was used as an "executable backend".
All Matlab/Octave operations (such as geometries and simulation
settings) are only wrapper to the underlying ``.xml`` file writer. Once
generated, openEMS is launched and took over the simulation independently.
As a result, the same ``.xml`` file can be directly used to replay the same
simulation via the ``openEMS`` command-line in the future, even without the
source code. For example, it can be useful for constructing a simulation on
the local machine, but running simulation on a headless server::

    openEMS simulation.xml

However, since the Matlab/Octave binding is only an ``.xml`` generator without
direct access to CSXCAD itself, the generated ``.xml`` file is "a one-way street"
that can't be reloaded as a Matlab/Octave data structure after the fact.
Source code must be kept if the generated structure or simulation needs any
future modifications. Overall, the Matlab/Octave binding works like a static
website generator. One can generate web pages, but can’t edit the HTML files
back into the source format.

Python
"""""""

In the Python binding, a decision was made to create a library-level binding to
both CSXCAD and openEMS. When geometries are created, rather than generating the
matching ``.xml`` code, it uses the actual funcions and internal data structure
within the CSXCAD library. As a result, it's possible to reload an existing
CSXCAD 3D ``.xml`` model via :meth:`~CSXCAD.ContinuousStructure.ReadFromXML`.

However, because the simulation is started by invoking openEMS as a library
directly rather than passing simulation parameters via ``.xml`` file, no
simulation parameters are written to the file. Hence the file is not standalone
and insufficient to start the simulation. Running the simulation requires a
functional Python script with both an instance of
:class:`~CSXCAD.ContinuousStructure` and an instance of :class:`~openEMS.openEMS`.

However, a sourceless simulation replay is partially possible, by reusing
an earlier CSXCAD 3D ``.xml`` model via :meth:`~CSXCAD.ContinuousStructure.ReadFromXML`
and setting up the rest.
If there's a need, in principle one can write a self-written lightweight wrapper
for this purpose (no built-in implementations exist currently)

.. note::
   **Replaying Simulations**. Sometimes it may be desirable to "replay" an
   existing simulation setup without access to the Matlab/Octave or Python
   source code. This is possible in Matlab/Octave, but only partially
   possible in Python.
   
   **Post-Processing**. In all cases, post-processing simulation results
   always requires source code. The program ``openEMS`` itself is only a
   field solver engine. For analysis, we rely on Matlab/Octave or Python
   routines.

   **Third-Party Apps**.  If you're developing a third-party simulator
   or binding based on openEMS, it's recommended to generate a simulation
   ``.xml`` and to call openEMS as an executable. The openEMS is a shared
   library, but it's so far not designed for public use. On the other
   hand, the CSXCAD library is designed to be publicly reusable, so it's
   acceptable to either generate the ``.xml`` yourself or invoke the CSXCAD
   library to do that, as a result, the recommendation is a hybrid of
   the approaches used by Matlab/Octave and Python bindings.

Modeling via a GUI?
------------------------

In principle, it's feasible to make or tweak a 3D model using the
:program:`AppCSXCAD` GUI. Geometries and mesh lines can be added
by the GUI (or an initial program), a modified version can be saved
and read into Python later for simulation via
:meth:`~CSXCAD.ContinuousStructure.ReadFromXML`.
This method circumvents programmatic modeling
(as decribed in :ref:`concept_primitives`) entirely - although it
has not been put in use by anyone to our best knowledge.

On the other hand, there are numerious attempts over the years
to create models using GUI-based or high-level tools, to varying
degrees of success.

The first general idea is to create the structure first in a
general-purpose CAD like FreeCAD. This can then be exported as
a 3D model and be loaded into CSXCAD via :func:`ImportSTL` for
simulation. By editing the CSXCAD object further, ports and
probes can also be modeled as a GUI.

The second general idea, specific to planar circuits and circuit
board simulations, is to first create the circuit board using an
EDA tool such as gEDA, pcb-rnd, or KiCad. The circuit layout
can then be exported as a 2D vector image format, such as
HyperLynx, Gerber, SVG or PDF. The polygons in these images
are then extracted and imported as CSXCAD polygons.

The third general idea, is to create a high-level programming
library for defining high-level objects such as traces, vias,
circuit board layers, so that they can be created one object
at a them, rather than one polygon at a time.

.. important::
   **Third-Party Tools.** These tools are developed by third
   parties, and not officially supported by the openEMS project.
   Most of them are highly experimental and incomplete.
   They're described here for completeness. The project forum
   is also open to the discussions of their uses.

   **Importing is easy, simulation is hard.** These tools
   should be considered advanced applications. Beginners are
   *not recommended* to try them before familiarizing themselves
   with the CSXCAD/openEMS workflow first via basic simulations,
   as described in :ref:`first_lessons`.
   Trying to import a circuit board without understanding the
   concept of ports, boundary conditions or meshing rules leads
   to failures, especially when most of these tools are highly
   experimental and incomplete.

   **Don't work in isolation.** By far there are already 7 different
   tools that attempt to automate modeling of circuit boards and
   3D objects for openEMS. Instead of creating another one from
   scratch, it's probably a good idea to have a discussion with
   the authors of these existing tools.

Examples of these tools include:

* :program:`FreeCAD-OpenEMS-Export`, developed by Lubomir Jagos.

  * FreeCAD-based model and port edits, with CSXCAD export.

  * https://github.com/LubomirJagos/FreeCAD-OpenEMS-Export

* :program:`IntuitionRF`, developed by Juleinn.
  
  * It allows one to mesh structures interactively via Blender.

  * https://github.com/Juleinn/IntuitionRF

* :program:`pcb2csx`, developed by Evan Foss.

  * It's a plugin to the EDA tool :program:`pcb-rnd`,
    allowing one to export an existing circuit board layout to CSXCAD.

  * http://repo.hu/cgi-bin/pool.cgi?project=pcb-rnd&cmd=show&node=s_param

* :program:`gerber2ems`, developed by Antmicro.

  * It allows one to export an existing PCB layout as a Gerber file,
    which can then be converted and imported as a CSXCAD model.

  * https://github.com/antmicro/gerber2ems

* :program:`pcbmodelgen`, developed by jcyrax.

  * It converts a KiCad layout file into the CSXCAD model,
    also with experimental auto-meshing support.

  * https://github.com/jcyrax/pcbmodelgen

* :program:`pyems`, developed by Matt Huszagh.
  
  * It's a high-level Python interface to openEMS, which allows
    the programmatic creation of high-level structures such as
    circuit boards, traces, vias, PCB layers. It has also an
    experimental auto-mesh generation algorithm.

  * https://github.com/matthuszagh/pyems

* :program:`hyp2mat`, developed by Koen De Vleeschauwer and
  distributed officially as part of openEMS.
  
  * It converts a
    HyperLynx layout file (can be generated by PCB EDA tools,
    including EAGLE or KiCad 6). The geometries are extracted
    to generate an Octave script with commands to create
    the CSXCAD model.

  * In principle, it can be used with Python
    as well, by exporting the model to XML in Octave via
    :func:`WriteOpenEMS`, and importing the model via 
    :meth:`~CSXCAD.ContinuousStructure.ReadFromXML`. But
    no one has tested it.

  * Currently it's retired and no longer maintained.

.. note::

   The old project wiki also described this following idea to
   convert circuit board layouts from Gerber, PDF, DXF, or
   G into CSXCAD models. This idea may be of interest to
   developers working on automated CSXCAD model generation.
   
   PCB layers in Gerber files can be converted to PDF by means of
   gerber2pdf which can be found on Sourceforge (editor's note:
   native PDF, SVG and DXF exports are available in many EDA packages).
   The PDF can be imported into Inkscape just as it is the case
   for DXF files. Within Inkscape, the usually closed paths can be
   modified (either manually or with filters) such that they result
   in a suitable list of polygon nodes for openEMS.
   
   Sometimes these polygons or curves have too many nodes. The number
   of nodes can be reduced with the Inkscape function "Path" > "Simplify".
   The amount of reduction is controlled by the parameter "Simplification
   Threshold" which can be found under "Preferences" > "Behavior". These
   paths are still Bézier curves which must be converted into polygons.
   This is achieved with "Extensions" > "Modify Path" > "Flatten Béziers".
   The parameter in this dialog also controls the number of resulting
   points.
   
   When all nodes are as required, the paths can be exported as a HTML5
   Canvas. The resulting file can then be processed with an ASCII Editor.
   The numbers after the moveTo and lineTo statements are the polygon nodes
   X- and Y- coordinates respectively. However, they still must be
   transformed ba a liner transform given in the transform statement. The
   first four numbers a matrix by which the node coordinates have to be
   multiplied and the remaining two numbers are a vector which has to
   be added.
   
   The result will be the node coordinates in HTML pixels with X counting
   from left to right and Y counting from top to bottom, which does not
   conform to the coordinate system of the Inkscape canvas.
   
   In order to have the same axes as in Inkscape (X left to right and Y
   bottom to top), the fourth an sixth number have to be multiplied by -1
   and the image height has to be added to the sixth number. Now the
   coordinates are in the usual coordinate system but still in HTML5 pixels.
   The ratio of pixels to mm or other units of length can finally be found
   under the document properties in Inkscape. This factor can be applied in
   Octave/Matlab. This finally gives polygons which can be processed by openEMS.
